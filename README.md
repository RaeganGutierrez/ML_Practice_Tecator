# Machine Learning Practice

This repository will be a catch all for previous homeworks or practice code when testing new models or techniques. 

**Current entries:**

*Linear Regression - Tecator* - R markdown file creating a few simple linear regression models using R's built in Tecator dataset. These models include linear regression, partial least squares, principle component regression, ridge regression, and elastic net. I then use R squared, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean average error (MAE) to compare results. 
    *relevant packages:* caret, e1071, pls, elasticnet, kernlab

*ML Practice- Linreg & RF Classification* - Python colab creating a linear regression model predicting mpg from the auto dataset and random forest classification model predicting wine quality from a red wine dataset. 
    *utilized packages: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn*
